# RandomWallpaper
My arch script for randomizing a wallpaper, generating its palette, and putting is in a file (to source)

# Requirements:

- [pywal](https://github.com/dylanaraps/pywal)
- [nitrogen](https://github.com/l3ib/nitrogen) (optional, use -n option if you want to use it)

And I think that is kinda all.

Once the "color_scheme" file is created, you can `source color_scheme` to use generated colors.
